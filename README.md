# VanillaJs

greetings

here i will upload projects using basic web technologies
like html, css, bootstrap and of course javascript.

the goal of this repository is to track my own progress as a developer, learn
git and maybe show this to my future employers

Today i improved the second project's interface with better bootstrap positioning, but i still don't understand about weather measurement so i want to read a little bit about celcius and farenheit units to understand better what i'm doing
